### Virtual Learning

Luckily, many components of the course have already been designed so that most of the work can be done remotely. We will meet for lectures, TA sections, and office hours during the scheduled times via [Zoom](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/phones/conferencing/zoom-video-conferencing/log-in/). You will be receiving announcements about homeworks in your email (or can check on the website), and you will be submitting your homeworks online through a tool called [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). You will be able to use an online platform for running your code, so no need for a power station at home. We will have a discussion forum online where you can ask your questions. Are we forgetting something? Most probably yes, but we can certainly figure it out and adjust pretty soon! Sounds like too many tools to figure out? We are learning too! And learning is better than not learning. 

* [Set-up UW Zoom](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/phones/conferencing/zoom-video-conferencing/log-in/)
	* Don't be a stranger: set up your profile with your name and picture
	* Express yourself: explore the [virtual backgrounds](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background) functionality
* Access to Zoom Meetings on Canvas
	* You will find the scheduled lectures, sections, and office hours on the Zoom tab of the course in Canvas
	* We plan to record lectures and make them available on Canvas under Zoom -> Cloud Recordings. They will be shared only with students in this course and teaching staff. The recording will capture the presenterâ€™s audio, video and computer screen. Student audio and video will be recorded if they share their computer audio and video during the recorded session. The recordings will only be accessible to students enrolled in the course to review materials. These recordings will not be shared with or accessible to the public. The University and Zoom have FERPA-compliant agreements in place to protect the security and privacy of UW Zoom accounts. Students who do not wish to be recorded should:Change their Zoom screen name to hide any personal identifying information such as their name or UW Net ID, and
Not share their computer audio or video during their Zoom sessions.
