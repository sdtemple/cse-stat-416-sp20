## Description

Provides practical introduction to machine learning. Modules include regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction with a focus on an intuitive understanding grounded in real-world applications. Intelligent applications are designed and used to make predictions on large, complex datasets.
* CSE 143 or CSE 160; and STAT 311 or STAT 390.

If you are missing some of the prerequisite material, you are responsible to learn it on your own (check out the [resources](/resources/) page). 

**Learning objectives:**

* Convert real world problems to machine learning problems
* Distinguish between different subproblems in machine learning
* Preprocess unstructured datasets for machine learning analysis
* Know and apply multiple machine methods and recognize their assumptions 
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms

## Getting Help

* [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k7vcouww2l45qs): You can find the access code to join Piazza on our course Canvas page

We use Piazza as an online Q&A forum where you may ask questions (both publicly and privately). If you have a question, this should be the first place to check & it's often the case that other students may have had the same question.

We also strongly recommend you monitor new questions asked on Piazza semi-regularly: seeing questions other students ask can often be surprisingly enlightening.

We do not have a course staff email so if you have a question about a particular concept or part of the assignment that you do not want to post publicly on Piazza, you should post privately so that the instructor or any of the TAs can answer. Students should prefer using Piazza instead of emailing individual staff members. Obviously, if your concern is a personal matter that you want to talk to the instructor about, you may email the instructor individually.

Note: The use of "Piazza Careers" is not required and you do not need to put any personal information in the website.
