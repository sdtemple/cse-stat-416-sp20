## Gradescope
For each homework, there will be three assignments listed on Gradescope.

The first will be tagged `Concept` which is where you will answer conceptual questions about that week's material. This counts towards to Concept portion of your final grade.

The second will be tagged `Programming` which is where you will answer questions you answered in the programming portion. This counts towards to Programming portion of your final grade.

The last section will be tagged `Upload` which is where you upload your Jupyter Notebook(s) for that week. This is technically not worth any points, but any submission that does not include the completed Jupyter Notebooks will receive a 0 for the programming portion.

### Option A - Google Colaboratory
If you are planning on using Colab, you'll have to save them to your Google Drive to edit and save them.

Once you have completed the assignment, you should download the Jupyter Notebook (File > Download .ipynb) and upload that to Gradescope. Remember, you should use the ipynb option!

### Option B - Local Development
If you are planning on using your local computer, make sure you have completed the [Software Setup](). Download the Jupyter Notebook (File > Download .ipynb). Launch the Jupyter Notebook using the Anaconda Navigator and navigate to the directory you downloaded the notebook.

Once you have completed the assignment, you should upload the completed notebooks to Gradescope. Remember, you should use the `.ipynb` files!
